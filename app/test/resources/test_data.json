The FTSE 100 share index closed up more than 2.2% at 6,733.97.\n\nIn Germany, the DAX gained about 1.7%, while France's CAC index also rose about 1.7%.\n\nMany markets have had a dismal year, as investor sentiment soured on fears of decelerating global growth, trade tensions and rising interest rates.\n\nJapan's Nikkei suffered its first annual loss in seven years, while Germany's Dax index closed the year down about 18% - the biggest annual loss in a decade.\n\nOn Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 ended 0.31% lower at 20,014.77, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed flat, at 25,504.20.\n\nIn the US, Friday's declines were fairly widespread. However, they spared the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers such as Amazon.\n\nAmazon shares jumped more than 1% on Friday, days after the e-commerce giant told investors it had a \"record-breaking\" holiday season.\n\nAnalysts cautioned that movements were exacerbated by the lower dealing levels seen during holiday trading.\n\nUS shares have been hit this week by weaker than expected home sales and consumer confidence data.\n\nConcerns about US-China trade tensions also resurfaced, with reports saying US President Donald Trump is considering an executive order banning the use of Chinese technology.",
